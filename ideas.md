A place to stash my stupid ideas so my brain do not have to keep track of them - not that am a idea machine but still don't want to keep reminding myself every few often the things that I wanted to try/do but didn't. At least they are here for any future(?) use. 

At least I want to capture them here before my conscience telling me that they aren't worth pursuing or point the 1000s of reasons why I shouldn't be doing them. 

### 1. Eisenhower To Do

Am a terrible procrastinator if something doesn't excite me I most likely wouldn't do it or at least wouldn't do it until the very last moment. 

Hence, I want a To Do list (yes 1 more To Do list application) that tracks my pending list of items against Importance & Urgency. This is a concept introduced by Eisenhower famously known as Eisenhower Matrix. Yes - there are few products out there in the market, but I didn't built them & certainly I don't want to pay  for them. So lets build it.

### 2. An App to track my day-to-day time

More like a time table of my 24 hours, I want to know how am I spending my 24 hours - probably most of them would be day dreaming, but still worth knowing for sure. 
    
    - Sleep (track with fitbit - I've it on my wrist almost all the time) 
    - Commuting
    - Other App usage (had to uninstall twitter, facebook & mute almost all the other apps)
    - Time spent at work? 

This would help me (probably?) to see where am wasting most of my time - how can I channel some of that towards my happiness.

### 3. Integrate Alexa (or any Voice Assistant) with Etsy

My wife is into Arts (good for her) and she has couple of shops in Etsy. I was wondering if it would be helpful for her to ask questions about her shops to Alexa/Cortana/Google. This I believe would come in handy when her hands are busy (dirty!). 

Sample Questions: Hey {any Assistant} 
* how is my shop doing today (/this week/this month)?
* did we get any orders today (this week/this month)
* what is the shipping status of my last (few/n) order(s)

Am sure she would have lot more questions to ask :)

How about extend this Shopify? 

### 4. A Finance Bot to simplify investing

I recently started to play with stocks (& lost $400 in the last week - am in it for long haul), as Buffet puts it **_"time in the market is more important than timing of the market"_** 

Am not finanically savvy not even by a long shot, hence I want to automate the process of identifying stocks that are hidden. There are literally 1000s of stocks - given that we can slice & dice them by numbers I want a bot/program that can digest those numbers and give a rank (oh yes Zacks & almost everyone does this isn't it). So I can then decide if I want to bet on them or not. Ofcourse I could handover my money to some ETFs/Mutual Funds/apps like Betterment but what fun would they be.
